Description:
    This will generate skeleton views and controller files that you will need to modify to suit your application.

Example:
    rails generate pure_admin:scaffold [MODEL_NAME]

    If you want quickedits for the controller use:
    rails generate pure_admin:scaffold [MODEL_NAME] --quickedits

    This will create:
        app/views/{pluralised model name}/_table.html.erb
        app/views/{pluralised model name}/_show.html.erb
        app/views/{pluralised model name}/_form.html.erb
        app/controllers/{pluralised model name}_controller.rb
